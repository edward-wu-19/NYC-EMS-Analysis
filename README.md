# NYC-EMS-Analysis
In NYC, EMS calls record both the times taken for dispatchers to arrive and the severity of the calls. We are interested in analyzing how these correlated with neighborhood income. This project was completed by Edward Wu and Vincent Qiu.

# Datasets
We used two datasets.

The dataset for EMS data is hosted on the NYC Open Data Catalog and contains the EMS dispatches from January 1, 2005 to October 13, 2024. This dataset can be found in its raw form at https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/EMS-Incident-Dispatch-Data/76xm-jjuj/about_data. We individually cleaned the dataset to use for our own analyses. Bince's version is EMS_Incident_Dispatch_Data_2021.csv, and can be found at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oZFuZormqNOjOdMOypVOuCBMD4xxuwl2/view?usp=sharing, and Edward's is Time_Dataset.csv, which can be found at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EaoG5LEjBCoDRs_kVpY8jruuyE6XezQc/view?usp=sharing.

The dataset we used for average neighborhood income is hosted by The Citizens' Committee for Children of New York, and contains the average household income for each neighborhood in 2021. It is referred to as Median Income.csv, and is present in the Github repo.
